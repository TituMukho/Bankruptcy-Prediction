This project was completed as part of an in-class Kaggle competition for the course 'Data Mining'.

The following are the key aspects of the solution:

1. Handling an imbalanced data set using SMOTE technique.
2. Using the XGBoost Algorithm to predict bankruptcy.
3. Using Randomized Grid Search to optimize the model.
4. Achieved an AUC score of 96.4%
